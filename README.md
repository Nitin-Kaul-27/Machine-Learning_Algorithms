# Machine-Learning-Algorithms
This repository contains Machine Learning Algorithm codes made in R programming without using inbuilt functions

All the codes were made for understanding the maths behind the Algorithms. 
Hope all of you will find them useful for your work.

NOTE: Naive Baiye's Code works only on categorical attributes
